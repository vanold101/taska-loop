# Taska-Loop Implementation Checklist

## A. Grocery list & cost-splitting
- [x] Basic list creation & management
- [x] Cost splitting (equal, percentage, fixed amounts)
- [x] Payment tracking
- [x] Instant list capture (barcode scan, receipt photo)
    -   **âœ… Implementation Details:**
        -   Implemented barcode scanning with react-qr-barcode-scanner
        -   Added UPCItemDB API integration for product lookup
        -   Created product database and save dialog for new products
        -   Added duplicate detection to prevent multiple identical items
        -   Implemented receipt scanning functionality
    -   **Research & Select Libraries:**
        -   Investigate React Native camera libraries (e.g., `react-native-camera`, `expo-camera`) for image capture.
        -   Explore OCR libraries (e.g., Tesseract.js, Google Cloud Vision API, AWS Textract) for text extraction from receipts.
        -   Evaluate barcode scanning libraries (e.g., `react-native-camera` with barcode detection, dedicated barcode scanning SDKs).
    -   **UI/UX Design:**
        -   Design a user-friendly interface for initiating scans (camera view, buttons for barcode/receipt).
        -   Create a review and confirmation screen for scanned items, allowing users to edit extracted data.
    -   **Barcode Scanning Implementation:**
        -   Integrate the chosen barcode scanning library.
        -   Implement logic to call a product database API (e.g., OpenFoodFacts, or a custom one) with the scanned barcode to fetch item details (name, category, average price).
        -   Populate the item fields in the app with fetched data.
    -   **Receipt Photo OCR Implementation:**
        -   Integrate the chosen OCR library/service.
        -   Develop image preprocessing steps if needed (cropping, rotation, contrast adjustment) to improve OCR accuracy.
        -   Implement parsing logic to extract item names, quantities, and prices from the OCR text output. This might involve regex or pattern matching.
        -   Handle cases where OCR is inaccurate or data is missing.
    -   **Item Addition Logic:**
        -   Allow users to add scanned/OCR-extracted items to the current grocery list.
        -   Ensure new items are correctly formatted and include all necessary fields (name, quantity, price if available, unit, etc.).
        -   **Backend Integration (Optional but Recommended):**
            -   Consider if OCR processing should happen on a backend server to offload client devices and protect API keys for cloud services.
- [ ] Adaptive units
    -   **Define Common Units & Conversions:**
        -   Compile a list of common grocery units (e.g., kg, g, lb, oz, L, mL, piece, pack).
        -   Establish standard conversion factors between compatible units (e.g., 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 lb = 16 oz).
    -   **UI for Unit Selection:**
        -   When a user adds/edits an item, provide a dropdown or input field for selecting the unit.
        -   As the user types a quantity, suggest common units or allow free-form input.
    -   **Smart Unit Suggestion (Optional):**
        -   Based on item name/category, suggest a default unit (e.g., "milk" defaults to "L" or "mL").
    -   **Conversion Logic:**
        -   Implement functions to convert quantities between units (e.g., if a recipe needs 500g of flour and user has 1kg, calculate remaining).
        -   Display total quantities for items in a consistent, user-preferred unit or the most logical unit (e.g., show 1.5 kg instead of 1500 g).
        -   **Context/Storage:**
            -   Ensure `TripItem` (or equivalent) in `TaskContext` and `tripService` can store the selected unit for each item.
- [ ] Smart categorization
    -   **Define Categories:**
        -   Create a predefined list of common grocery categories (e.g., Produce, Dairy, Meat, Bakery, Pantry, Frozen, Beverages, Household).
    -   **Categorization Logic:**
        -   **Keyword-based:** Develop a system that assigns a category based on keywords in the item name (e.g., "apple" -> Produce, "milk" -> Dairy). This might involve a dictionary of keywords to categories.
        -   **Machine Learning (Advanced):** Train a simple text classification model on a dataset of item names and their categories.
        -   **User History:** Learn from how users categorize items over time.
    -   **UI for Categorization:**
        -   When adding an item, automatically suggest a category.
        -   Allow users to manually override or select a category from the predefined list.
        -   Display items grouped by category in the grocery list view.
        -   **Storage:**
            -   Add a `category` field to the `TripItem` interface and store it in `TaskContext`/`tripService`.
- [ ] Recurring items
    -   **Data Model:**
        -   Define how recurring items will be stored. This might involve a new data structure or extending the existing `TripItem`.
        -   Fields needed: `itemId` (to link to a base item definition), `frequency` (daily, weekly, monthly), `nextDueDate`, `startDate`, `endDate` (optional).
    -   **UI for Setting Recurrence:**
        -   When adding/editing an item, provide an option to mark it as recurring.
        -   Allow users to select the recurrence pattern (e.g., every Tuesday, every 2 weeks, 1st of the month).
    -   **Logic for Adding to Lists:**
        -   Implement a system (e.g., a daily check or a function triggered on app open/list creation) that identifies recurring items due to be added.
        -   Automatically add these items to the relevant grocery list (or a dedicated "Recurring Items" list).
    -   **Notifications (Optional):**
        -   Remind users about upcoming recurring items.
- [ ] Shopping history
    -   **Data Storage:**
        -   Ensure completed trips and their items (with prices, quantities, dates) are persistently stored (Firebase, local storage if not already robust).
        -   Consider if `tripService.ts` needs modification for archiving or marking trips as "historically significant".
    -   **UI for History View:**
        -   Create a new page or section to display past shopping trips.
        -   Allow users to view details of past trips (items, total cost, date, store).
        -   Implement filtering/sorting (by date, store, total cost).
    -   **Data Aggregation (Optional):**
        -   Calculate and display summary statistics (e.g., average spending per month, most frequently bought items).
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV
    -   **Select Libraries:**
        -   For PDF: `jspdf`, `react-pdf`.
        -   For CSV: `papaparse` or custom string generation.
    -   **Data Preparation:**
        -   Functions to gather the data for the current grocery list (or selected history) to be exported.
        -   Format data appropriately for PDF (layout, tables) or CSV (rows, columns).
    -   **UI for Export:**
        -   Add "Export" buttons (e.g., "Export as PDF", "Export as CSV") in the grocery list view or shopping history.
    -   **File Generation & Download:**
        -   Implement logic to generate the file in the chosen format.
        -   Trigger a file download in the browser.

## B. Price intelligence
- [ ] Price tracking across stores
    -   **Data Model:**
        -   Define a data structure to store item prices at different stores over time.
        -   Fields: `itemId`, `storeId` (or name), `price`, `dateRecorded`.
    -   **Data Input:**
        -   Allow users to manually input prices for items they see at different stores.
        -   Potentially integrate with OCR for receipt scanning to capture prices from multiple stores.
    -   **Storage:**
        -   Use Firebase or a similar backend to store this price data centrally.
    -   **UI for Price Input/Viewing:**
        -   When viewing an item, show its price history across stores.
        -   Provide an interface for users to add a new price sighting.
- [ ] Best price recommendations
    -   **Algorithm:**
        -   When a user adds an item to their list, query the price tracking data.
        -   Identify the store(s) that recently offered the lowest price for that item (and similar items).
    -   **UI for Recommendations:**
        -   Display a "Best Price Found At..." suggestion below the item in the list.
        -   Consider proximity if location data for stores is available.
- [ ] Price history
    -   **Data Retrieval:**
        -   Fetch price data for a specific item from the database.
    -   **UI - Charts/Graphs:**
        -   Display a line chart showing the price of an item over time, potentially filterable by store.
        -   Use a charting library (e.g., `recharts`, `chart.js`).
- [ ] Price alerts
    -   **User Configuration:**
        -   Allow users to set a target price for specific items.
        -   UI to manage these alerts (add, edit, delete).
    -   **Notification System:**
        -   Implement a backend process (e.g., Firebase Cloud Functions) that periodically checks if any item prices have dropped below user-set alert thresholds.
        -   Send push notifications or in-app notifications.
- [ ] Store-specific deals
    -   **Data Source:**
        -   Manual input by users (community-sourced).
        -   Potential for web scraping (complex, ethical considerations) or API integration if stores provide them.
    -   **Data Model:**
        -   Store details: `dealDescription`, `item`, `store`, `validFrom`, `validTo`, `discountType` (%, fixed amount).
    -   **UI for Deals:**
        -   A dedicated "Deals" section in the app.
        -   Highlight deals relevant to items in the user's current grocery list.
- [ ] Bulk buying recommendations
    -   **Algorithm:**
        -   Analyze item price per unit (e.g., price/kg, price/L).
        -   Compare unit price for different package sizes of the same item.
        -   Factor in user's consumption rate (if available from shopping history).
    -   **UI:**
        -   When a user adds an item, suggest if a larger package size offers better value.
        -   "Consider buying X in bulk to save Y%".
- [ ] Price prediction
    -   **Data Requirements:**
        -   Significant historical price data for various items.
    -   **Algorithm (Advanced):**
        -   Time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA models) or machine learning regression models to predict future price trends.
        -   Requires data science expertise.
    -   **UI:**
        -   "Price likely to increase/decrease in the next X weeks."

## C. Rotating chores
- [x] Basic chore assignment
- [x] Rotation scheduling (initial setup, needs logic for `nextRotationDate`)
    -   **Update `TaskContext.tsx` & `taskService.ts` (if applicable for backend persistence):**
        -   In `addTask` and `updateTask`:
            -   If `rotationFrequency` is set and `task.status` is "completed" (or a similar trigger), calculate `nextRotationDate`.
            -   Store the calculated `nextRotationDate`.
    -   **`calculateNextRotationDate` Function:**
        -   Create a utility function `calculateNextRotationDate(currentDate: Date, frequency: RotationFrequency): Date`.
        -   Based on `frequency` ('daily', 'weekly', 'bi-weekly', 'monthly'), add the corresponding duration to `currentDate`.
        -   Handle edge cases (e.g., end of month for monthly rotations).
    -   **Completion Logic:**
        -   When a rotating chore is marked complete:
            -   Call `calculateNextRotationDate` using its `completionDate` (or `Date.now()`) and `rotationFrequency`.
            -   Update the chore's `nextRotationDate` in the context/backend.
            -   Reset the chore's status to "pending" or "open".
    -   **UI Display:**
        -   Ensure `nextRotationDate` is displayed clearly on chore cards/details.
        -   Potentially indicate overdue rotating chores.
- [x] Completion tracking
- [x] Chore preferences
    -   **User Profile Extension:**
        -   Add a section in user profiles (Firebase and `AuthContext` state) to store chore preferences.
        -   Data model: `userId`, `choreId` (or `choreType`), `preferenceLevel` (e.g., like, dislike, neutral), `notes` (optional).
    -   **UI for Setting Preferences:**
        -   In user settings or a dedicated chore management area, allow users to indicate preferences for specific chores or types of chores.
    -   **Assignment Consideration:**
        -   When assigning chores (manually or automatically), display or factor in user preferences. This is more relevant for automated assignment.
- [x] Difficulty weighting
    -   **Chore Definition Extension:**
        -   Add a `difficulty` field to the `Task` interface (e.g., a number from 1-5 or labels like "Easy", "Medium", "Hard").
    -   **UI for Setting Difficulty:**
        -   When creating/editing a chore, allow setting its difficulty.
    -   **Usage:**
        -   Can be used in reports/dashboards to show effort distribution.
        -   Can be a factor in automated chore assignment algorithms (balancing workload).
- [ ] Time-based scheduling (Beyond simple rotation, e.g., "Clean fridge every 1st Monday of the month")
    -   **Advanced Recurrence Rules:**
        -   Investigate libraries for handling complex recurrence patterns (e.g., `rrule.js` which implements iCalendar RFC 5545).
        -   Update the `Task` interface: instead of just `rotationFrequency`, use a more flexible `recurrenceRule` (e.g., an RRULE string).
    -   **UI for Complex Scheduling:**
        -   Provide a more advanced scheduling UI, perhaps using a calendar or rule builder, to define these complex patterns.
        -   This would likely replace or augment the simple `rotationFrequency` dropdown.
    -   **`nextDueDate` Calculation:**
        -   Use the chosen recurrence library to calculate the `nextDueDate` based on the `recurrenceRule` and the last completion date.
- [ ] Chore history
    -   **Data Logging:**
        -   When a chore is completed, log its `choreId`, `userId` (who completed it), `completionDate`, and any relevant notes.
        -   Store this history in Firebase.
    -   **UI for History View:**
        -   A new page/section to display chore completion history.
        -   Filterable by chore, user, date range.
- [ ] Chore statistics
    -   **Data Aggregation:**
        -   From chore history, calculate statistics:
            -   Chores completed per user.
            -   Most/least frequently completed chores.
            -   On-time completion rates.
    -   **UI - Dashboards/Reports:**
        -   Display these statistics using charts and tables in the household dashboard or a dedicated chore analytics section.

    -   **Analysis & Aggregation:**
        -   Calculate spending over time periods (weekly, monthly, yearly).
        -   Break down spending by category (e.g., "Produce", "Dairy").
        -   Break down spending by store.
    -   **UI - Charts & Visualizations (e.g., using `Recharts` or similar):**
        -   Line chart for total spending over time.
