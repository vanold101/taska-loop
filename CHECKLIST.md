# Taska-Loop Implementation Checklist

## A. Grocery list & cost-splitting
- [x] Basic list creation & management
- [x] Cost splitting (equal, percentage, fixed amounts)
- [x] Payment tracking
- [x] Instant list capture (barcode scan, receipt photo)
    -   **✅ Implementation Details:**
        -   Implemented barcode scanning with react-qr-barcode-scanner
        -   Added UPCItemDB API integration for product lookup
        -   Created product database and save dialog for new products
        -   Added duplicate detection to prevent multiple identical items
        -   Implemented receipt scanning functionality
    -   **Research & Select Libraries:**
        -   Investigate React Native camera libraries (e.g., `react-native-camera`, `expo-camera`) for image capture.
        -   Explore OCR libraries (e.g., Tesseract.js, Google Cloud Vision API, AWS Textract) for text extraction from receipts.
        -   Evaluate barcode scanning libraries (e.g., `react-native-camera` with barcode detection, dedicated barcode scanning SDKs).
    -   **UI/UX Design:**
        -   Design a user-friendly interface for initiating scans (camera view, buttons for barcode/receipt).
        -   Create a review and confirmation screen for scanned items, allowing users to edit extracted data.
    -   **Barcode Scanning Implementation:**
        -   Integrate the chosen barcode scanning library.
        -   Implement logic to call a product database API (e.g., OpenFoodFacts, or a custom one) with the scanned barcode to fetch item details (name, category, average price).
        -   Populate the item fields in the app with fetched data.
    -   **Receipt Photo OCR Implementation:**
        -   Integrate the chosen OCR library/service.
        -   Develop image preprocessing steps if needed (cropping, rotation, contrast adjustment) to improve OCR accuracy.
        -   Implement parsing logic to extract item names, quantities, and prices from the OCR text output. This might involve regex or pattern matching.
        -   Handle cases where OCR is inaccurate or data is missing.
        -   **Backend Integration (Optional but Recommended):**
            -   Consider if OCR processing should happen on a backend server to offload client devices and protect API keys for cloud services.

    -   **UI for Unit Selection:**
        -   When a user adds/edits an item, provide a dropdown or input field for selecting the unit.
        -   As the user types a quantity, suggest common units or allow free-form input.
    -   **Smart Unit Suggestion (Optional):**
        -   Based on item name/category, suggest a default unit (e.g., "milk" defaults to "L" or "mL").
    -   **Conversion Logic:**
        -   Implement functions to convert quantities between units (e.g., if a recipe needs 500g of flour and user has 1kg, calculate remaining).
        -   Display total quantities for items in a consistent, user-preferred unit or the most logical unit (e.g., show 1.5 kg instead of 1500 g).
        -   **Context/Storage:**
            -   Ensure `TripItem` (or equivalent) in `TaskContext` and `tripService` can store the selected unit for each item.

    -   **Categorization Logic:**
        -   **Keyword-based:** Develop a system that assigns a category based on keywords in the item name (e.g., "apple" -> Produce, "milk" -> Dairy). This might involve a dictionary of keywords to categories.
        -   **Machine Learning (Advanced):** Train a simple text classification model on a dataset of item names and their categories.
        -   **User History:** Learn from how users categorize items over time.

        -   Allow users to select the recurrence pattern (e.g., every Tuesday, every 2 weeks, 1st of the month).
    -   **Logic for Adding to Lists:**
        -   Implement a system (e.g., a daily check or a function triggered on app open/list creation) that identifies recurring items due to be added.
        -   Automatically add these items to the relevant grocery list (or a dedicated "Recurring Items" list).
    -   **Notifications (Optional):**
        -   Remind users about upcoming recurring items.
- [x] Shopping history

## C. Rotating chores
- [x] Basic chore assignment
- [x] Rotation scheduling (initial setup, needs logic for `nextRotationDate`)
    -   **Update `TaskContext.tsx` & `taskService.ts` (if applicable for backend persistence):**
        -   In `addTask` and `updateTask`:
            -   If `rotationFrequency` is set and `task.status` is "completed" (or a similar trigger), calculate `nextRotationDate`.
            -   Store the calculated `nextRotationDate`.
    -   **`calculateNextRotationDate` Function:**
        -   Create a utility function `calculateNextRotationDate(currentDate: Date, frequency: RotationFrequency): Date`.
        -   Based on `frequency` ('daily', 'weekly', 'bi-weekly', 'monthly'), add the corresponding duration to `currentDate`.
        -   Handle edge cases (e.g., end of month for monthly rotations).
    -   **Completion Logic:**
        -   When a rotating chore is marked complete:
            -   Call `calculateNextRotationDate` using its `completionDate` (or `Date.now()`) and `rotationFrequency`.
            -   Update the chore's `nextRotationDate` in the context/backend.
            -   Reset the chore's status to "pending" or "open".
    -   **UI Display:**
        -   Ensure `nextRotationDate` is displayed clearly on chore cards/details.
        -   Potentially indicate overdue rotating chores.
- [x] Completion tracking
- [x] Chore preferences
    -   **User Profile Extension:**
        -   Add a section in user profiles (Firebase and `AuthContext` state) to store chore preferences.
        -   Data model: `userId`, `choreId` (or `choreType`), `preferenceLevel` (e.g., like, dislike, neutral), `notes` (optional).
    -   **UI for Setting Preferences:**
        -   In user settings or a dedicated chore management area, allow users to indicate preferences for specific chores or types of chores.
    -   **Assignment Consideration:**
        -   When assigning chores (manually or automatically), display or factor in user preferences. This is more relevant for automated assignment.
- [x] Difficulty weighting
    -   **Chore Definition Extension:**
        -   Add a `difficulty` field to the `Task` interface (e.g., a number from 1-5 or labels like "Easy", "Medium", "Hard").
    -   **UI for Setting Difficulty:**
        -   When creating/editing a chore, allow setting its difficulty.
    -   **Usage:**
        -   Can be used in reports/dashboards to show effort distribution.
        -   Can be a factor in automated chore assignment algorithms (balancing workload).
- [ ] Time-based scheduling (Beyond simple rotation, e.g., "Clean fridge every 1st Monday of the month")
    -   **Advanced Recurrence Rules:**
        -   Investigate libraries for handling complex recurrence patterns (e.g., `rrule.js` which implements iCalendar RFC 5545).
        -   Update the `Task` interface: instead of just `rotationFrequency`, use a more flexible `recurrenceRule` (e.g., an RRULE string).
    -   **UI for Complex Scheduling:**
        -   Provide a more advanced scheduling UI, perhaps using a calendar or rule builder, to define these complex patterns.
        -   This would likely replace or augment the simple `rotationFrequency` dropdown.
    -   **`nextDueDate` Calculation:**
        -   Use the chosen recurrence library to calculate the `nextDueDate` based on the `recurrenceRule` and the last completion date.
- [ ] Chore history
    -   **Data Logging:**
        -   When a chore is completed, log its `choreId`, `userId` (who completed it), `completionDate`, and any relevant notes.
        -   Store this history in Firebase.
    -   **UI for History View:**
        -   A new page/section to display chore completion history.
        -   Filterable by chore, user, date range.
- [ ] Chore statistics
    -   **Data Aggregation:**
        -   From chore history, calculate statistics:
            -   Chores completed per user.
            -   Most/least frequently completed chores.
            -   On-time completion rates.
    -   **UI - Dashboards/Reports:**
        -   Display these statistics using charts and tables in the household dashboard or a dedicated chore analytics section.

    -   **Analysis & Aggregation:**
        -   Calculate spending over time periods (weekly, monthly, yearly).
        -   Break down spending by category (e.g., "Produce", "Dairy").
        -   Break down spending by store.
    -   **UI - Charts & Visualizations (e.g., using `Recharts` or similar):**
        -   Line chart for total spending over time.

        -   Bar chart for spending by store.
        -   Filters for date ranges.

- [ ] Chore performance
    -   **Data Source:**
        -   Aggregated data from `chore history` and `chore statistics`.
